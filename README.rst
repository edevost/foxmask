  :alt: Documentation Status

This project is intended to be used by ecology
researchers wishing to implement an automated workflow
of image analysis. It is in early stage of development
but is already giving promising results.

What if FoxMask ?
=================


A tool to automatically analyze images taken by RECONYX cameras.
Theses cameras are triggered by a motion detection system and
FoxMask has been written to be able to isolate moving objects with
very short image sequences (minimum of 5).
It is written in Python and depends on C++ libraries. Please read
our `latest documentation`_ for more information about the project.
